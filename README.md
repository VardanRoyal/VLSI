In this work we present the optical domain implementation of an n- bit hybrid adder circuit using terahertz optical asymmetric demultiplexer (TOAD). The work is
completed in two phases. In initial phase, we show the na√Øve design of TOAD based circuit for ripple carry and carry look ahead adder,carry select adder and then in the final phase the design has been
improved by taking optical cost and delay into account. The presented theoretical model promises both higher processing speed and accuracy. From the experimental verification we have
seen that the proposed model not only has enhanced the cost of the design but also has reduced overall delay of the design. For fair analysis, we have compared the incurred design cost metrics
with related work results, where a considerable improvement in our proposed design model is registered.
